# Arrays lab


## Question 1

Create an array of strings called `colors` that contain "orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", and "lavender".

Then, using array subscripting and string interpolation, print out the String `"orange, yellow, and lavender are some of my favorite colors"`.

```
var colors = ["orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", "lavender"]

print("\(colors[0]), \(colors[2]), and \(colors[4]) are some of my favorite colors")
```

## Question 2

Remove "Illinois" and "Kansas" from the array below.

`var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]`
```
westernStates.removeSubrange(4...5)

print(westernStates)
```
## Question 3

Iterate through the array below. For each state, print out the name of the state, a colon, and whether it is or is not **in the continental United States.**

`let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]`

```
let notInUSA = ["Hawaii", "Alaska"]

for (_, word) in moreStates.enumerated() {
    if word == "Hawaii" || word == "Alaska" {
        print("\(word) : no")
        } else {
            print("\(word) : yes ")
}
}
```
## Question 4

Print out how many non-whitespace characters are in `myString`:

`let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"`

```
let myStringArray = (Array)(myString)

myString.replacingOccurrences(of: " ", with: "")
print(myString.count)
```

Iterate through the array below. For each sentence, print out how many non-whitespace characters are in it.

`let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]`

```
for (_, element) in myFavoriteQuotes.enumerated() {
    print(element.replacingOccurrences(of: " ", with: "").count)
}
```
## Question 5

Iterate through `garden` and place any 🌷 that you find into the `basket`. Replace any 🌷 that you pick up with `"dirt"`. Then print how many 🌷 are in your `basket`.

```swift
var garden = ["dirt","🌷","dirt","🌷","dirt","dirt","🌷","dirt","🌷","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()
```
```
for (index, element) in garden.enumerated() {
    if element == "🌷" {
        basket.append(element)
        garden[index] = "dirt"
}}
print("There are \(basket.count) flowers in the basket")
```
## Question 6

The below array represents an unfinished batting lineup for a baseball team. **You, the coach,** need to make some last minute changes:

- Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
- Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
- Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
- Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.

`var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]`

```
for (index, element) in battingLineup.enumerated() {
if element == "Jeter" {
    battingLineup[index] = "Tejada" }
if element == "Thomas" {
    battingLineup[index] = "Guerrero"}
}
battingLineup.remove(at: 0)
battingLineup.append("Suzuki")
battingLineup.insert("Reyes", at: 7)
print(battingLineup)
```

## Question 7

Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.  

(The built-in `contains(_:)` function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)


```swift
var numbers: [Int]

let target: Int = 32
```
```
var numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]
var doesItContain = true
let target: Int = 32

for  n in numbers {
    if n == target {
        doesItContain = true
        break
    }else {
        doesItContain = false
}
}
print(doesItContain)
```


## Question 8

Find the largest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built-in `max()` method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```
```
var largestNumber = 0

for number in arrayOfNumbers {
    if number > largestNumber {
        largestNumber = number
}}
print(arrayOfNumbers)
print("The largest number in the array is \(largestNumber)")
```


## Question 9

Find the smallest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built in min() method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
```
```
var smallestNumber = Int.max

for number in arrayOfNumbers {
    if number < smallestNumber {
        smallestNumber = number
}}
print(arrayOfNumbers)
print("The smallest number in the array is \(smallestNumber)")
```


## Question 10

Iterate through `secondListOfNumbers`, and print out all the odd numbers.

`var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]`

```
var oddNumbers = [Int]()

for number in secondListOfNumbers {
    if number % 2 != 0 && oddNumbers.contains(number) == false {
        oddNumbers.append(number)
}
}
print(oddNumbers)
```

This prints the odd numbers without repeating any. If you wish to simply list all of the odd numbers, whether they repeat or not, eliminate the &&oddNumbers.contains statement and simply print number after line 190. 

## Question 11

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`
```
var sum = 0

for number in thirdListOfNumbers {
sum += number
}
print(sum)
```

## Question 12

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum of all the even numbers.

`var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]`

```
var sum = 0

for number in thirdListOfNumbers {
    if number % 2 == 0 {
        sum += number
}}
print(sum)
```



## Question 13

Append every Int that appears in both `listOne` and `listTwo` to the `sharedElements` array. Then print **how many Ints** are shared.

```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()
```
```
var sharedNumberCounter = 0

for numbers in listOne {
    sharedElements.append(numbers)
}

for numbers in listTwo {
    if sharedElements.contains(numbers){
        sharedNumberCounter += 1
}
    sharedElements.append(numbers)
}
print(sharedElements.sorted())
print("There are \(sharedNumberCounter) shared numbers.")
```

## Question 14

Write code such that `noDupeList` has all the same Ints as `dupeFriendlyList`, but has no more than one of each Int.

```swift
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []
```
```
for number in dupeFriendlyList {
    if noDupeList.contains(number) == false {
        noDupeList.append(number)
}}
print(noDupeList)
```
## Question 15

Find the second smallest number in an Array of Ints

`let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}`

```
var arraySorted = [Int]()


for number in arrayOfNumbers {
    if arraySorted.contains(number) == false {
        arraySorted.append(number)
        }}
print(arraySorted.sorted())
print("The second smallest number in the array is \(arraySorted.sorted()[1]).")
```

## Question 16

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

```
var range = 1..<1000
var multiples = [Int]()

for number in range where number % 3 == 0 || number % 5 == 0 {
multiples.append(number)
}
print(multiples.reduce(0,+))
```

## Question 17

Make an array that contains all elements that appear **more than twice** in `someRepeatsAgain`.

```swift
var someRepeatsAgain = [25,11,30,31,50,28,4,37,13,20,24,38,28,14,44,33,7,43,39,35,36,42,1,40,7,14,23,46,21,39,11,42,12,38,41,48,20,23,29,24,50,41,38,23,11,30,50,13,13,16,10,8,3,43,10,20,28,39,24,36,21,13,40,25,37,39,31,4,46,20,38,2,7,11,11,41,45,9,49,31,38,23,41,16,49,29,14,6,6,11,5,39,13,17,43,1,1,15,25]
```
```
var numbers = [Int]()
var repeats = [Int]()


for number in someRepeatsAgain {
    if numbers.contains(number) == false {
        numbers.append(number)
}
    else {
        repeats.append(number)
}
}
print(someRepeatsAgain.sorted())
print(repeats.sorted())
```

## Question 18

Identify if there are 3 integers that sum to 10 in the following array. If so, print them as a triplet. If there are multiple triplets, print all possible triplets.

`var tripleSumArr = [-20,-14, -8,-5,-3,-2,1,2,3,4,9,15,20,30]`

    if compare.reduce(0,+) > biggestArray.reduce(0,+) {
        biggestArray = compare
}
}
print(biggestArray)

```

## Question 21

Input: `[(4,2), (-3,-3), (1,1), (3,9)]`

Output: `[(-3,-3), (1,1)]`
```
var input = [(4,2), (-3,-3), (1,1), (3,9), (6,6), (4,6)]

Input: `[true, false, true, true]`

Output: `false`
